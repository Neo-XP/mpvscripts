# mpvscripts
KiSM's mpv scripts

### Why?
I created this project to:
- Implement the VLC crop hotkey
- Implement the VLC aspect ratio hotkey

More scripts may come in the future.

### File location

Where to put mpv lua scripts, create the folders if the don't exist:

\*nix:

`~/.config/mpv/scripts`

Windows:

`%appdata%\mpv\scripts`
